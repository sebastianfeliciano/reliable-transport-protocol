#
#  This Makefile is designed to compile the starter code and create 4700recv and 4700send.
#  Usage:
#       make gson.jar  # download GSON jar (Optional)
#       make 
#
#  Students must submit a separate Makefile with their submission that compiles 
#  their code. Whether the '4700recv' and '4700send' script is created by the Makefile is 
#  the developer's decision.

# NOTE:
# The starter code uses the GSON library for JSON serialization and deserialization.
# You can replace this with another JSON library of your choice, such as org.json or Jackson.
# Ensure that your chosen library correctly encodes and decodes messages while maintaining
# the expected structure required by the simulator.
#
# By uncommenting the line below, you acknowledge the starter code uses GSON and that
# you can modify it to use the JSON library of your choice.
